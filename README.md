Diabetes Detection using SVM
This machine learning project focuses on predicting whether a person has diabetes or not using the Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm. The model is trained on medical data and aims to classify patients as diabetic or non-diabetic based on various health indicators.

Project Overview
The goal of this project is to use an SVM classifier to predict diabetes based on features such as glucose level, BMI, age, and insulin levels. Early detection of diabetes can help in managing and reducing the risk of complications, and machine learning models can play a significant role in providing quick and accurate diagnoses.

Key Features
Binary classification: Predicts whether a person has diabetes (1) or does not have diabetes (0).
Support Vector Machine (SVM): A powerful and widely used classification algorithm, particularly effective for binary classification tasks like this.
